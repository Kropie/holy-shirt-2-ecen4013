# Visuals Prototyping #
### Kaitlin Hehmann - The Rajamani Tsunami ###



## I. Description ##

As stated in the research documentation, the Holy Shirt projectâ€™s package will be a vest. Fabric was used on the prototype to show device placement and give an example of the Templar cross that might be used for visuals for the completed project. The top of the vest was opened at the seams to expose the inside of the vest where the wires will ultimately be run through. It was also opened to show that the padding can be taken out easily to ensure the user can feel the motors of the haptic feedback. The pockets are smaller than expected due to a divider added in the center of each pocket, but this can be easily removed to accommodate the power supply casing and the MCU casing if we choose to keep them there.
