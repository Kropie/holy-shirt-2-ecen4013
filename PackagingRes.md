### Visual Packaging: ###
Gen X Global Reversible Chest Protector
|Cost|$18.95|
|:---|:-----|
|Features|Pockets, Reversible, Fully Padded|

For the packaging we decided to go with a simple utility vest. The pockets allow for easy storage for the power supply, the MCU, and whatever else needs to be attached to the vest. The padding for the vest allows us to cut inside of the vest and hide the wires to be fed to the various components. This packaging proved to be the cheapest and the most versatile. More parts can be easily added (shoulder pads to attach the IR receivers and haptic feedback motors) later on through sewing for greater functionality and for an increased visual appeal.

### Wiring Array: ###
The wiring array will consist of various wires fed throughout the shirt. The wires will be encased by sleeves of basic fabric to keep the wires from turning into a spaghetti monster mess. These sleeves will then be sewn to the inside of the vest to keep everything in its place.

### IR Placement: ###
The IR receivers will be placed on each of the cardinal directions of the shirt; one on the front, one on each shoulder pad, and one on the back. By placing them on each of the cardinal directions of the shirt, the IR receivers will be able to absorb packets from various directions. The IR transmitters will be placed on both sides—front and back—of the shirt. By placing them on both sides of the shirt, the IR transmitters will be able emit IR packets in all directions.

## II. Secondary Approach ##

### Visual Packaging: ###
ML Kishigo – Ultra-Cool Multi-Pocket Vest Class 2 Safety Vest
|Cost|$13.99|
|:---|:-----|
|Features|Outside Pockets, Inner Pockets, Lightweight/breathable|

For our second alternative, we looked into a safety vest. Like the utility vest, the safety vest allows us to carry most of our components on board. Despite the slightly cheaper price, we decided to not to go with this vest due to the lack of padding and the obnoxious yellow color. Without the padding, it will be harder to keep the wires hidden within the vest and something could be easily pulled out of place and then messed up. We would have to go ahead and add an extra inside lining to fix this.

### Wiring Array: ###
An alternative method for the wiring array would be to use zip ties to keep the wires together and maintain some order form them within the packaging. While not as hidden as the previous wiring array, this array also allows us to give a more visually desirable array than just mass chaos stuffed in a shirt.

### IR Placement: ###
The IR receivers will be placed on each of the cardinal directions of the shirt; one on the front, one on each shoulder pad, and one on the back. By placing them on each of the cardinal directions of the shirt, the IR receivers will be able to absorb packets from various directions. The IR transmitters will be placed on both sides—front and back—of the shirt. By placing them on both sides of the shirt, the IR transmitters will be able emit IR packets in all directions.

## III. Alternative Approach ##

### Visual Packaging: ###
Fruit of the Loom Cotton T-Shirt
|Cost|$3.00|
|:---|:----|
|Features|Lightweight, Inexpensive|

For our third alternative, this is as basic as it gets. Due to how basic the shirt is, we can add a lot more to it to make it more visually appealing and give easy alterations (pockets, a liner). The price and light weight are a plus, but without the pockets and the added padding, the shirt falls to the last alternative for the project.
