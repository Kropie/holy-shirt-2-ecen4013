# Integration 2 #



## Summary: ##

Integration 2 is the final product for this project including the final casing and professional printed circuit board. For the Holy Shirt, there are 5 circuit boards. The two shoulder boards, and the two back boards contain an IR receiver/transmitter pair, a haptic feedback motor, and a RGB status LED. All other components are located on the main board in the cross casing. The final schematics, CAD files, and PCB layouts are included below.
