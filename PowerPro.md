# Power Supply Prototyping #

## Summary ##

To prototype our power source I simulated maximum load by chaining 3 resistors together in parallel. I connected the power source to the 5V regulator so that the output was regulated and the voltage wouldn’t drop. I then connected the regulated 5V to the 3 resistors in parallel (10 Ω, 18Ω, and 45Ω).  This will draw .89A of current.  Our maximum current draw with everything running should be .88A. I then let it run for 2 hours and 20 minutes and I checked the voltage every 10 minutes. (9:40 PM – 12:00 AM).  I recorded this data in an Excel spreadsheet and plotted the results.
