## Summary ##

The casing for the board is pretty simple.  I made it a half inch thick in total.
It seems like the plan is to have the board case, and mount the LED PowerLevel Bar
and an LED Ring in it.  That is what the openings are. Then a peice of fabric with a Templar
Cross over it will be stiched over the vest with the cross overlaying the LED Bar, and the Ring
in the center of the cross. A picture from google images is also attached to give a
visualization of the idea.
