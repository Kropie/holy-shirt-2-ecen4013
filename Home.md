## Project Description ##
Straight out of the laboratories of ECEN4013 Team 1 - The Rajamani Tsunami - comes the latest advance in MAGE gameplay. The new Holy Shirt, version 2.0, is an advanced piece of armor that absorbs damaging attacks and stores these attacks to be released in one massive attack. Players must keep close eye on their power level though; if over 50 packets are stored, the shirt will overload, causing the user to reset the shirt, and creating a true "Holy Shirt" moment.
