**Design Idea A:**

Keeping with the holy shirt we can make a knight’s Templar cross casing on the front. We can fill it with an LED array and use it as a power level display.  The power source will be enclosed in an aluminum project enclosure and placed in a pouch in the back of the vest.

**Design Idea B:**

A proposed design is to make an “Iron Man” like casing on the chest.  The center light can indicate whether or not the shirt has power (or is turned on) and the outer ring can be used as a power level display. Again, the power source will be placed in a rectangular project enclosure and placed in a pouch on the back.

**Design Idea C:**

A third design idea would be to make a long thin rectangular casing.  It can be lined with LEDs and used as a power level indicator similar to the health bars in the “Dead Space” games. Again, the power source will be placed in a rectangular project enclosure and placed in a pouch on the back.

## II. Alternative Approach ##

An alternative approach is to simply use rectangular project enclosures hidden away in pocket.  Then the decoration and theme can be applied with fabric and paint.  This idea is boring and limits creativity. It is affordable compared to 3d printing, but limits the creativity of the package design. That is why it is the alternative and we would like to avoid it.
